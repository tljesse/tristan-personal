Another day another blog. For years I have had the intention to write a blog and to keep up with it consistently. Every couple of years I will redesign my personal website, setup a blog, write in it for a few weeks or months but without fail I will eventually stop writing and abandon the whole endevour. With this version I promise that I will (maybe) keep up with writing it and never (or eventually) abandon the whole thing. *I actually wrote most of this article in August 2021 then never finished it, so it just might be that my promise doesn't hold much weight...*

Every time I start up writing I can't decide on what the overall theme of the blog will be (maybe this is a reflection of my personality). So this time around I will do the same and not commit to this being a tech blog, a lifestyle blog or just a whatever anything blog. There will be times I will want to write about tech and other times I'll stray far away and talk about fish perhaps. I don't expect many people to read and I don't have much motivation to promote this so doing it however I might want works perfectly.

In the past few years I have started up my own web development agency after years of planning to do so. Now we have consistent work and aim to grow steadily in the coming years. If you are interested you can check out Arthas Development at our website <a href="https://arthas.dev">https://arthas.dev</a>. There we have a tech/marketing blog that does actually have a theme and ***should*** have consistent updates. The last few years with Arthas has kept me very busy with managing a team, searching for additional clients and attempting to expand all while balancing time continuing to code and learn new skills.

The agency is still going although the push for growth has stopped and it is more of maintaining the current speed. My work as a freelancer has essentially ended and transitioned to one of the leaders of the startup <a href="https://amptify.com">Amptify</a>. Now I am running the technical side of that company as well as the development team, on top of Arthas this keeps me quite busy. My day to day coding has decreased and my time is consumed being a leader and other business activities.

## The Day to Day

My time as the defacto CEO, project lead and whatever other title I need at the moment, has occassionally been a difficult transition. There are many things needed to successfully run a buisness that cover skills within marketing, sales, accounting as well as others. This isn't wholely different from simply working as a freelancer, where I would bid on projects, selling myself essentially, and eventually coming to an agreement. From here I would work with the client or sometimes the client's team, help to decide the best technical plan and finally execute it. With this I am the owner from start to finish and I have refined this process over the years as a freelancer. 

The agency model that I have built is more of an offering for a part time CTO to clients rather than just making apps or websites to order. I do prefer this model in whole as I have more say in overall direction as well as more of an investment in the result. Although at first it was hard to break from the habits and routine I built as a freelance programmer, I have come to a flow and comfort of the new day to day responsibilites. Now I guide others to build something and review their work while always looking ahead to the next hurdles to clear. I've had to relinquish some control over the details within the code and not check that every bit is exactly how I would want to do it, something that the perfectionist in me has had to learn to cope with. I have tried to pass on my own style guide but at the end of the day, checking every detail to make sure that is followed is not worth the effort. I now try to pass as much knowledge to the team as I can, and raise the quality of everyones work to match our expectations.

I've also had to learn how to refocus time on things that in the past I would not put much importance on. Planning for the quarter, creating reports and charts for non technical people to review. As a coder I found it easier to just go out and build then figure a lot parts out along the way. Within a group that could still work, only if you aren't the head of the snake. Getting everything to mesh together takes extra effort which I have to balance with the ocassional dive back into difficult coding tasks when needed. The time that I now spend coding is invaluable and the tasks which I do decide to take on have increased in difficulty. The buck stops with me for all parts of every project I touch, no matter whether I've physically written the code or not. I feel the responsibility of it and am still learning how to handle it.

## Wrap It Up Already

Like I said, this article has been sitting gathering electonic dust for six (*24*) months. I feel like there isn't really a conclusion to it which is probably why I never published it. Getting this out there is just a step towards a habit of writing which I hope to continue. Coming up, I have recently released another project [Decordle](https://decordle.io/) which I plan to go into detail about in an upcoming article. See you next time!
