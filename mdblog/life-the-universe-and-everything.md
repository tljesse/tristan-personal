Another day another blog. For years I have had the intention to write a blog and to keep up with it consistently. Every couple of years I will redesign my personal website, setup a blog, write in it for a few weeks or months but without fail I will eventually stop writing and abandon the whole endevour. With this version I promise that I will (maybe) keep up with writing it and never (or eventually) abandon the whole thing. *I actually wrote most of this article in August 2021 then never finished it, so it just might be that my promise doesn't hold much weight...*

Every time I start up writing I can't decide on what the overall theme of the blog will be (maybe this is a reflection of my personality). So this time around I will do the same and not commit to this being a tech blog, a lifestyle blog or just a whatever anything blog. There will be times I will want to write about tech and other times I'll stray far away and talk about fish perhaps. I don't expect many people to read and I don't have much motivation to promote this so doing it however I might want works perfectly.

In the past few years I have started up my own web development agency after years of planning to do so. Now we have consistent work and aim to grow steadily in the coming years. If you are interested you can check us out Arthas Development at our website <a href="https://arthas.dev">https://arthas.dev</a>. There we have a tech/marketing blog that does actually have a theme and ***should*** have consistent updates. The last year with Arthas has kept me very busy with managing a team, searching for additional clients and attempting to expand all while balancing time continuing to code and learn new skills.

## Running an Agency

During my time as the defacto CEO, project lead and whatever other title I need at the moment has occassionally been a difficult transition. There are many things needed to successfully run a buisness that cover skills within marketing, sales, accounting as well as others. This isn't wholely different from simply working as a freelancer, where I would bid on projects, selling myself essentially, and eventually coming to an agreement. From here I would work with the client or sometimes the client's team, help to decide the best technical plan and finally execute it. With this I am the owner from start to finish and I have refined this process over the years as a freelancer.

Now as an agency owner I sometimes find it hard to break from the habits and routine I built as a freelance programmer. My comfort zone as you may call it is in writing code and building a complete product. Here with Arthas I have to change to be more of the project manager. Guiding others to build something and reviewing their work. I've had to relinquish some control over the details within the code and not check that every bit is exactly how I would want to do it. I have tried to pass on my own style guide but at the end of the day, checking every detail to make sure that is followed is not worth the effort.

Even spending too much time focusing on project management is a sink hole as I need to do even more to really build the business. It is easy for me to get absorbed into just the management of the project and spend all my time making sure everything is running smoothly. While this does bring great results and ultimately a better final product, it does take away from focus on growing the buisness. How do I decide what the best balance is for the best outcome? My time spent on a project is invaluable and I would be missed if I am focused on other things. On the other hand, while working to grow the business may not have immediate results, in the long run if we are able to bring on more people to work on something we can improve out output speed and quality. I am certain that I am not the first person to think about this issues and try to find the solution. 

## Wrap It Up Already

Like I said, this article has been sitting gathering electonic dust for six months. I feel like there isn't really a conclusion to it which is probably why I never published it. Getting this out there is just a step towards a habit of writing which I hope to continue. See you next time!
