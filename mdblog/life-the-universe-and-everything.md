# Life, the Universe and Everything

Another day another blog. For years I have had the intention to write a blog and to keep up with it consistently. Every couple of years I will redesign my personal website, setup a blog, write in it for a few weeks or months but without fail I will eventually stop writing and abandon the whole endevour. With this version I promise that I will (maybe) keep up with writing it and never (or eventually) abandon the whole thing.

Every time I start up writing I can't decide on what the overall theme of the blog will be (maybe this is a reflection of my personality). So this time around I will do the same and not commit to this being a tech blog, a lifestyle blog or just a whatever anything blog. There will be times I will want to write about tech and other times I'll stray far away and talk about fish perhaps. I don't expect many people to read or have much motivation to promote this so doing it however I might want works perfectly.

In the past few years I have started up my own web development agency after years of planning to do so. Now we have consistent work and aim to grow steadily in the coming years. If you are interested you can check us out Arthas Consulting, LLC at our website <a href="https://arthas.dev">https://arthas.dev</a>. There we have a tech/marketing blog that does actually have a theme and ***should*** have consistent updates. The last year with Arthas has kept me very busy with managing a team, searching for additional clients and attempting to expand all while balancing time continuing to code and learn new skills.
