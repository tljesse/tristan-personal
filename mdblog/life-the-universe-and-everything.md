# Life, the Universe and Everything

Another day another blog. For years I have had the intention to write a blog and to keep up with it consistently. Every couple of years I will redesign my personal website, setup a blog, write in it for a few weeks or months but without fail I will eventually stop writing and abandon the whole endevour. With this version I promise that I will (maybe) keep up with writing it and never (or eventually) abandon the whole thing.

Every time I start up writing I can't decide on what the overall theme of the blog will be (maybe this is a reflection of my personality).

There will be times I will want to write about tech and other times I'll stray far away and talk about fish perhaps. I don't expect many people to read or have much motivation to promote this so doing it however I might want works perfectly.

In the past few years I have started up my own web development agency after years of planning to do so. Now we have consistent work and aim to grow steadily in the coming years.

There are many things needed to successfully run a buisness that cover skills within marketing, sales, accounting as well as others. This isn't wholely different from simply working as a freelancer, where I would bid on projects, selling myself essentially, and eventually coming to an agreement. From here I would work with the client or sometimes the client's team, help to decide the best technical plan and finally execute it. With this I am the owner from start to finish and I have refined this process over the years as a freelancer.

Now as an agency owner I sometimes find it hard to break from these habits. My comfort zone as you may call it is in writing code and building a complete product. Here with Arthas I have to change to be more of the project manager. Guiding others to build something and reviewing their work. I've had to relinquish some
